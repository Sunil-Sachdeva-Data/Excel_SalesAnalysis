# Sales Insights Dashboard (Excel)
This project is an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze and present sales performance across regions, products, and customer segments. Using advanced Excel features such as PivotTables, Slicers, XLOOKUP, and INDEX-MATCH, the dashboard allows users to filter data dynamically, track KPIs like total sales and average order value, and identify top-performing categories and trends. It provides insights into monthly and quarterly sales patterns, repeat purchase behavior, and customer segmentation. The goal of this project is to showcase how Excel can be used not just for data storage but also for decision support, reporting automation, and business storytelling.
